Here are some free (or freemium) APIs and data sources you can use for Indian crop, agriculture, disease, and related environmental data:

⸻

🇮🇳 1. India’s Open Government Data Platform (data.gov.in)
	•	Managed by the Indian government under NDSAP, this portal provides API access to various agriculture-related datasets—including crop yields, production stats, market prices—after registering and generating a free API key  ￼ ￼.
	•	Data spans from historical statistics to current releases from ministries like Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare.

Pros: Official, comprehensive, well-structured.
Cons: Mostly macro/statistical; limited for per-field or disease-specific use.

⸻

🛰️ 2. AgroMonitoring API
	•	Offers a free tier with access to satellite imagery, NDVI/EVI indices, weather, soil moisture, and UV, scalable by polygon  ￼.
	•	Ideal for remote sensing inputs into disease-detection models (e.g. canopy health, moisture anomalies).

Pros: Rich geospatial data and vegetation indices.
Cons: Limited call volumes in free plan, requires polygon management.

⸻

🚜 3. Farmonaut API (India-based)
	•	Provides free APIs for crop forecasting, pest/disease alerts, fertilizer/urea pricing, and satellite imagery  ￼.
	•	Developed in India, offering domain-specific features like pest/disease model integration.

Pros: Includes disease-specific alerts and harvest forecasts.
Cons: May require registration; usage limits not clearly stated publicly.

⸻

🌐 4. NDAP / API-Setu
	•	The National Data & Analytics Platform (NDAP) aggregates government datasets—including agriculture—that can be programmatically accessed  ￼ ￼.
	•	API Setu serves as a central API marketplace with both government and private data feeds  ￼.

Pros: One-stop access to many government APIs including agriculture.
Cons: API key required; coverage depth varies.

⸻

📸 5. PlantDoc / Open Plant Disease Images (for CV training)
	•	Not real-time APIs, but open datasets like PlantDoc (~2.6K annotated plant leaf images across 13 species) and PlantVillage (~50K leaf images) useful for fine-tuning disease detection models  ￼.

Pros: Great labeled data for image-based model training.
Cons: Static datasets only—not real-time or geolocated.

⸻

🧠 6. Academic Pest Datasets – BOLLWM
	•	A unique real-world pest image dataset (~5 years of cotton bollworm captures across India), useful for pest-detection or classification model training  ￼.

⸻

✅ Recommended Strategy
	1.	Register and grab free API keys from:
	•	data.gov.in – for statistical/agro-economic data.
	•	AgroMonitoring – for satellite & vegetation data.
	•	Farmonaut – for India-specific crop disease and fertilizer APIs.
	•	NDAP/API Setu – for broader government data streams.
	2.	Ingest and preprocess:
	•	Use satellite/NDVI/micro-weather to detect anomalies.
	•	Correlate with statistical data on crop types, seasons, zones.
	•	Combine with pesticide/fertilizer price data to support advisory logic.
	3.	Fine-tune image models using PlantDoc, PlantVillage, and BOLLWM to detect disease/pest symptoms locally.

🛠️ Useful API Endpoints

Source	Data Available	Free Key?	Limitations
data.gov.in	Crop yields, production, area stats	✅ Yes	Macro-level only
AgroMonitoring	NDVI/EVI, weather, soil, UV by polygon	✅ Yes	Low quota free tier
Farmonaut	Satellite images, disease/pest alerts, forecast	✅ Yes	Usage limits not public
NDAP / API Setu	Govt datasets via combined APIs	✅ Yes	Varies by dataset

Combine these with open image datasets for robust disease detection.
